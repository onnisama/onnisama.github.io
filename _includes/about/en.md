Hello! I’m Kiriushio, a student majoring in Software Engineering at Tongji University, and also a beginner just stepping into the world of computer science.

In the coming years of my university life, I’ll use this blog to record my learning experiences, share small achievements, and write about little reflections from everyday life. I’ll also be posting personal articles in the future!

I warmly welcome every visitor here, whether you’re an old friend or someone new. Feel free to share your suggestions and thoughts with me—I hope we can learn and grow together!
